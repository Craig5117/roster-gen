## Usage

To use Roster Gen, open a CL terminal to the root directory for the application. Run `node index` to start the app. You will be first be prompted to enter information for the team manager. After you have finished entering the manager, you will be taken to a menu where you can add an engineer or an intern. Add as many team members as you would like. When you are finished, select quit and it will generate an HTML file with your team roster in the dist directory as "index.html".
